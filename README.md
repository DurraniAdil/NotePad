# NotePad
Here's a simple "NotePad" that I built mostly for personal use.
The styling and colouring provides me with a better environment to focus and write better.
There are various features in the NotePad :
1. It performs a word count as you write, making it a viable tool to keep track of the words you have written so far.
2. A dark theme button which makes it easier on the eyes while working in a dark environment or using it for longer durations.
3. A delete button which clears out the writing space, so you can clear the workspace and write something new once you're done.
4. A copy button which lets you directly copy whatever is written in the workspace to your clipboard.
5. A save button which saves your note to your system as a text file.
   The workspace is resizeable so you can shape it as you want and work away
   And both the Title and Author space is editable so you can edit your title and your name as the author as you wish.
